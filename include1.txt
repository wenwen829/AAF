Total Energy Expenditure is calculated from age, gender, weight, 
height and the activity factor. The Harris Benedict Equation was
used for calculating energy expenditure rate.

TEE = BEE x AF
BEE (F) = 655 + 9.6 (Wt) + 1.8 (Ht) -4.7 (age)
BEE (M) = 66 + 13.7 (Wt) + 5.0 (Ht) -6.8 (age)

TEE = Total Energy Expenditure (kcal/d)
Age = Age (years)
gender = Gender (Male)
Wt = Body Weight (kg)
Ht = Body Height (cm)
activity = Activity (factor)
BEE = Basal Energy Expenditure (kcal/d)
F= female. M= male.

Activity equals 30% for sedentary, 50% for moderate and 100% for 
strenous activity (% of the BEE).
